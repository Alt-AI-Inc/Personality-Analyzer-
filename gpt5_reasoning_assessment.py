{trait_description}

Please analyze these writing samples step-by-step:

STEP 1: EVIDENCE IDENTIFICATION
Identify specific examples from the writing that suggest high, moderate, or low {trait_name}. Quote specific phrases or sentences.

STEP 2: PATTERN ANALYSIS  
Look for consistent patterns across multiple samples. Are there recurring themes or behaviors?

STEP 3: CONTRADICTORY EVIDENCE
Identify any evidence that contradicts your initial assessment. Are there examples that suggest the opposite?

STEP 4: CONTEXT CONSIDERATION
Consider how the medium (social media/messages) might influence the expression of this trait. Might the real trait be different from what's expressed?

STEP 5: CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT
Based on the quantity and quality of evidence, how confident are you in your assessment?

STEP 6: FINAL SCORING
On a scale of 1.0-5.0, where would you place this person on {trait_name}?
1.0 = Very Low, 2.0 = Low, 3.0 = Moderate, 4.0 = High, 5.0 = Very High
